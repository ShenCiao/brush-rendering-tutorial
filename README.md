# Brush Rendering Tutorial

This is the code repository for "Brush Rendering Tutorial".
Remember to star this code repository instead of bookmark the website since the host and domain might be changed.

The website will be WIP for a long time since rendering brush strokes with GPU is a newly emerged research topic.
We (Shen Ciao, Zhongyue Guan) will continuously update tutorials on (potentially) influential research works.

## Be critical


## Build and Develop

The textual contents are written in markdown, you can easily modify them without extra web development skills.

Follow the guidance in [Docusaurus's documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs/installation) for further development.

- threejs: WebGL wrapper
- monaco-editor/react: Code editor

While creating this tutorial, shen has just started learning these JavaScript libraries.
