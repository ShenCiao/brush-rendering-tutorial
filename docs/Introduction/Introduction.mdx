This tutorial series will teach you how to use the modern GPU graphics pipeline to render **brush strokes**,
those are commonly seen with a paint tool in graphics design software like Photoshop.

import {
  ArticulatedLine2D,
  pencilBrushUniforms,
} from "@site/src/components/ArticulatedLine2D";

<div className="row row--no-gutters margin-left--xs">
  <div className="col col--6">
    <ArticulatedLine2D />

  <div className="col col--6">

When hovering your mouse on the canvas you can:

- **Pan**: Left-click and drag the mouse.
- **Zoom**: Scroll or drag the mouse wheel.

The contents mainly come from my research work [Ciallo: The next generation vector paint program][Ciallo].
Since there will be more research work on GPU brush stroke rendering,
I will continuously update this tutorial series to teach you related techniques in (potentially) influential research works.

## Prerequisites
Decent experience in one of the GPU graphics APIs like OpenGL and D3D is required.
If you were relatively new to computer graphics, you should at least have rendered your first 3D scene and practiced instanced rendering.
In this tutorial, we will learn techniques to render and stylize curves.

Though I create all the demos in the web environment, you don't need to know about WebGL or WebGPU.
We will concentrate on high-level techniques rather than the implementation details.
No matter which GPU API you are familiar with, utilizing them to render a stroke will be easy after this tutorial series.

## Structure

### Content
The [Basic](../category/basics/) section covers the basics of the rendering and stylization methods.
Articles in the Basic part are organized in a linear fashion.
You may miss something important if skip one of them.
After learning all stuffs in the Basic section, you can select your favorite topics in the TOC to learn.
I will list extra prerequisites at the very beginning of each article.

### Live coding
You will find live code editors like the one below. which is inspired by [_The Book of Shader_].
The rendering result is updated in real time after modifying the code.
Try it out by changing the variable `maxRadius` and `segmentCount` and watching the changes in the canvas below.

<ArticulatedLine2D showEditor={[true, false, false]} />

:::note code editor

If there are bugs for common usages, tell me at the [issue](https://github.com/ShenCiao/brush-rendering-tutorial/issues) page.

:::

Feel free to change any other parts of the code as long as it returns the `position` and `radius` array correctly.

Only geometry generation code "geometry.js" is demonstrated here.
You will find "vertex.glsl" and "fragment.glsl" for vertex and fragment shader code.
Whether they are hidden or shown will depend on the context.

:::note Research Tip

To demonstrate your research work about brush rendering, select vector drawings have variable radius or pen pressure data.
Regular vector drawing datasets don't contain them.
