This tutorial series will teach you how to use the modern GPU graphics pipeline to render brush strokes,
commonly seen with a paint tool in graphics design software like Photoshop.
The contents mainly come from **Anonymous**.
Since there will be more research work on GPU brush stroke rendering,
I will continuously update this tutorial series to teach you related techniques in (potentially) influential research works.

## Prerequisites

Decent experience in one of the GPU graphics APIs like OpenGL and D3D is required.
If you were relatively new to computer graphics, you should at least have rendered your first 3D scene and practiced instanced rendering.

GPU apis have built-in line rendering functionalities.
It's totally fine if you never heard about `LINES`, `LINE_STRIP`, and `LINE_LOOP` GPU primitives.
We won't use the functionalities in this tutorial series.
If you're interested in learning about their drawbacks, you can check out mattdesl's article titled [Drawing Lines is Hard](https://mattdesl.svbtle.com/drawing-lines-is-hard).
Reading it isn't a prerequisite, I still recommend it.

Though I create all the demos in the web environment, you don't have to know about WebGL or WebGPU.
We will concentrate on high-level techniques rather than the implementation details.
No matter which GPU API you are familiar with, utilizing them to render a stroke will be easy after this series.

## Structure

### Content

The [Basic](../category/basics/) section covers the basics of the rendering and stylization methods.
Articles in the Basic part are organized in a progressive fashion.
You may miss something important if skip one of them.
After learning the Basic section, you can freely select your favorite topics.
I will list extra prerequisites at the very beginning of each article.

### Live coding

You will find live code editors similar to the one displayed below, inspired by [_The Book of Shader_].
The rendering result is updated in real-time after modifying the code.
Give it a try by altering the values of `maxRadius`, and watch how the canvas below changes.

<ArticulatedLine2D showEditor={[true, false, false]} />

Only geometry generation code "geometry.js" is demonstrated here.
You will find "vertex.glsl" and "fragment.glsl" for vertex and fragment shader code.
Whether they are hidden or shown will depend on the context.
