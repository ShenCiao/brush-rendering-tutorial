This tutorial series will teach you how to use the **modern GPU** graphics pipeline to render **brush strokes** on **vector curves**.
The contents mainly come from my research work [Ciallo: The next generation vector paint program][Ciallo].
I will introduce this tutorial from the three aspects above.

## Modern GPU

_Draw lines in Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad._

Drawing lines or rendering strokes is one of the oldest topics in Computer Graphics.
You can easily find a lot of pioneering works, for example, [Bresenham's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm).
They emerged from an era with certain conditions:

- Programs ran without the benefit of parallelization.
- Programs could access framebuffer directly without significant performance penalty.

But time has changed, now we have modern GPU hardware crafted for graphics and parallel computing,
and directly accessing a GPU framebuffer from a CPU can significantly hurt the performance.
So old algorithms may not satisfy your needs for real-time rendering.

In this tutorial, you will learn about the stroke rendering algorithms designed for the GPU graphics pipeline.
We (I and my mentor [Liyi-Wei](https://www.liyiwei.org/)) name these algorithms as _Articulated_ in our paper (mainly because they look like drawing an articulated arm).
I assume our readers are already familiar with a graphics API like OpenGL or D3D.
This tutorial will concentrate more on the high-level algorithms than the implementation details.

Although graphics APIs provide us line primitives, including `LINES`, `LINE_STRIP`, and `LINE_LOOP`,
there are several well-known issues when using these primitives directly.
Check out Matt Deslauries' article [Drawing Lines is Hard](https://mattdesl.svbtle.com/drawing-lines-is-hard#line-primitives_1) if you know nothing about them.
As for us, the most significant issue is the limitation on the maximum line width or stroke radius.
We must be able to fully control the radius values when rendering brush strokes.

## Brush strokes

Brush strokes refer to strokes drawn with the paint tool in graphics software such as Photoshop or Krita.
Artists configure their digital brushes to control stroke properties like radius or stylization,
then stroke on the canvas with dedicated input devices: Tablet and Stylus.
If you're unfamiliar with tablets and styluses, you can watch the video below for more information:

[![Tablet](https://img.youtube.com/vi/83BRMfjJXIk/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=83BRMfjJXIk)

While you may recognize a brush stroke by its stylization, another crucial property could be ignored: the varying radius along the stroke, we will call it **mutable radius** here.
The radii are typically generated from the pressure values as a stylus presses and moves on a tablet.
For experienced artists, one of the highest priorities is to configure the mapping function from pen pressure to brush radius after installing a painting program.

In this tutorial, you will learn to render a stroke with mutable radius, and the most popular way to stylize it called "Stamp."
You cannot find them elsewhere since they come from our own research.
Additionally, GPU brush stroke rendering a newly emerged topic.
Researchers will develop more novel methods in the future.
So I will continuously update this tutorial series to teach them.

## Vector curves

Mutable radius is imperative for the most artists when working on digital painting,
but it's not defined in public vector standards like SVG.
This limitation is one of the primary reasons why lots of digital artists don't use vector workflow.
(Another one is filling color.)

To support the mutable radius, we will render a unique type of vector curve:
An ordered list of points (polyline) with radius values assigned to each point.
As a stylus is pressed and moved on a tablet, the program generate a sequence of points to record the trace of movement.
Additionally, the pen pressure is transformed into the radius value assigned to each point.

We can approximate any type of curve by increasing the number of points in a polyline, whether freehand-drawn or mathematically defined.

## Structure

Although the algorithms are very straightforward, I know how hard it could be to learn and replicate a research work.
That's why I created this tutorial, designed with a smooth learning curve and providing seamless coding environments.

Start with the Basic part, which covers the basics of the rendering methods.
Please read the articles in the Basic part in order, or you may miss something important.
Next, select your favorite topics to learn.
I will list the extra prerequisites at the very beginning of the articles.

Wish you happy learning!

:::note Research Tip

To demonstrate your research work, select vector drawings have mutable radius or pen pressure data.
Regular vector drawing datasets don't contain them.
