This tutorial series will teach you how to use the **modern GPU** graphics pipeline to render **brush strokes** on **vector curves**.
The contents mainly come from my research work [Ciallo: The next generation vector paint program][Ciallo].
I will introduce this tutorial from the three aspects above.

## Modern GPU

_Draw lines in Ivan Sutherland's Sketchpad._

Drawing lines or rendering strokes is one of the oldest topics in Computer Graphics.
You can easily find a lot of pioneering works, for example, [Bresenham's line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm).
They emerged from an era with certain conditions:

- Programs ran without the benefit of parallelization.
- Programs could access framebuffer directly without significant performance penalty.

But time has changed, now we have modern GPU hardware crafted for graphics and parallel computing,
and directly accessing a GPU framebuffer from a CPU can significantly hurt the performance.
So old algorithms may not satisfy your needs for real-time rendering.

In this tutorial, you will learn about the brush stroke rendering algorithms designed for the GPU graphics pipeline.
We (I and my mentor [Liyi-Wei](https://www.liyiwei.org/)) call these algorithms _Articulated_ in our paper, because they look like drawing an articulated arm.
I assume our readers are already familiar with a graphics API like OpenGL or D3D.
This tutorial will concentrate more on the high-level algorithms than the implementation details.

Although graphics APIs provide us line primitives, including `LINES`, `LINE_STRIP`, and `LINE_LOOP`,
there are several well-known issues when using these primitives directly.
Check out Matt Deslauries' article [_Drawing Lines is Hard_](https://mattdesl.svbtle.com/drawing-lines-is-hard#line-primitives_1) if you know nothing about them.
As for our brush rendering, the most significant issue is the limitation on the maximum line width or stroke radius (half width).
We must be able to fully control the radius values when rendering brush strokes.

## Brush strokes

Brush strokes refer to strokes drawn with the paint tool in graphics software such as Photoshop or Krita.
Artists configure their digital brushes to control stroke properties like radius or stylization,
then stroke on the canvas with dedicated input devices: Tablet and Stylus.
If you're unfamiliar with tablets and styluses, you can watch the video below for more information:

[![Tablet](https://img.youtube.com/vi/83BRMfjJXIk/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=83BRMfjJXIk)

While you may recognize a brush stroke by its stylization, another crucial property could be ignored: the variable radius along the stroke.
(I ignored it in my paper too.)
The radii are typically generated from the pressure values as a stylus presses and moves on a tablet.
For experienced artists after installing a painting program, one of the highest priorities is to configure the mapping function from pen pressure to brush radius.

In this tutorial, you will learn to render a stroke with variable radius, and the most popular way to stylize it called "Stamp."
More than 90 percent of brushes in popular paint software are the stamp brushes.
Additionally, GPU brush stroke rendering a newly emerged topic.
Researchers will develop more novel methods in the future.
So I will continuously update this tutorial series to teach them.

## Vector curves

Variable radius is imperative for the most artists working on digital painting,
but it's not included in public vector standards like [SVG](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/Proposals/Variable_width_stroke).
And since that, configuring the variable width value of vector lines is commonly underdeveloped in popular graphics design software.
This limitation is one of the primary reasons that lots of digital artists don't use vector workflow.
(Another one is filling color.)

To support the variable radius, we will render a unique type of vector curve:
An ordered list of points (polyline) with radius values assigned to each point.
As a stylus is pressed and moved on a tablet, the program generate a sequence of points to record the trace of movement.
Additionally, the pen pressure is transformed into the radius value assigned to each point.

We can approximate any type of curve by increasing the number of points in a polyline, whether freehand-drawn or mathematically defined.
Try to change the `maxRadius` and `segmentCount` value in the code editor below to see how the stroke changes.
Feel free to change any other parts of the code as long as the function return the `position` and `radius` array correctly.

import { ArticulatedLine2D } from "../../src/components/ArticulatedLine2D";

<ArticulatedLine2D showEditor={[true, false, false]} />

:::info code editor & canvas

The development environment is inspired by [_The Book of Shader_].
You can watch the rendering result in real time after modifying the code.

When hovering your mouse on the canvas you can:

- **Pan**: Left-click and drag the mouse.
- **Zoom**: Scroll or drag the mouse wheel.

If there are bugs for common usages, tell me at the [issue](https://github.com/ShenCiao/brush-rendering-tutorial/issues) page.

## Structure

Although the algorithms are very straightforward, I know it's hard to learn and reproduce a research work.
That's why I created this tutorial, designed with a smooth learning curve and providing the seamless development environment.

You should start with the Basic part, which covers the basics of the rendering methods.
Remember to read the articles in the Basic part in its original order, or you may miss something important.
Next, select your favorite topics to learn.
I will list extra prerequisites at the very beginning of each article.

Wish you happy learning!

:::note Research Tip

To demonstrate your research work about brush rendering, select vector drawings have variable radius or pen pressure data.
Regular vector drawing datasets don't contain them.
