### Airbrush

Airbrush is a special type of stamp brush.
Learn the mathematical derivation from discrete to continuous stamp to get a "continuous airbrush".

### Stamp density and "ratio-distance"

Control stamp density along the polyline and render a critical stamp placing pattern called ratio-distance.
Very important for a serious project.

### 3D stroke

Learn how to extend the algorithms to 3D space.
