### Airbrush

<ArticulatedLine2D uniforms={airBrushUniforms} />

Airbrush is a special type of stamp brush.
Here I'm demonstrating a "continuous airbrush", which is mathematically continuous and needs a little bit of calculus to develop.
You will learn how to generalize a stamp brush into a continuous form.

### Stamp density and "ratio-distance"

<div className="row row--no-gutters margin-left--xs">
  <div className="col col--6">
    <ArticulatedLine2D uniforms={dotBrushUniforms} />
    <center>
      <em> Adjacent Dots </em>
    </center>
  </div>
  <div className="col col--6">
    <ArticulatedLine2D uniforms={dotHalfBrushUniforms} />
    <center>
      <em> Adjacent with one dot interleaved </em>
    </center>
  </div>
</div>
<br/>

You can see dots are adjacent to each other instead of equidistantly distributed.
The pattern is achieved by setting the intervals between dots proportional to their radii.
You will learn how to freely control stamp density along a stamp
stroke. Very important for a serious project.

### 3D stroke

Learn how to extend the algorithms to 3D space.

I'm integrating it into the Blender Grease Pencil:
