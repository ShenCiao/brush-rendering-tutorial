## In Progress

Telling a good story is as hard as inventing a novel method and teaching it.

### Airbrush

Airbrush is a special type of stamp brush.
Learn the mathematical derivation from discrete to continuous stamp to get a "continuous airbrush".

### Stamp Density and "Ratio-distance"

Control stamp density along the polyline and render a critical stamp placing pattern called ratio-distance.
Very important for a serious project.

### 3D Stroke

Learn how to extend the rendering methods to 3D space.

I'm integrating it into the Blender Grease Pencil:
