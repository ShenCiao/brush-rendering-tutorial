There were works trying to tessellate a stroke and render it with GPU.
You can find them in several papers and online articles.

They may inspire some approaches to optimize the performance of the articulated algorithms in the future.
To learn about them, I would recommend starting with Rye Terrell's [Instanced Line Rendering](https://wwwtyro.net/2019/11/18/instanced-lines.html),
whose methods are simple enough to learn.

As for this article, I will compare the tessellation-based algorithms with articulated algorithms in detail.

:::note spoiler

The key benefit of the articulated is its self-overlapping in acute angle, which is critical for brush strokes and digital painting.
