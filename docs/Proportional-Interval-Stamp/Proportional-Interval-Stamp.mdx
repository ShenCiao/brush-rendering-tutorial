## Stamp patterns

### Fixed interval
In the [Stamp](../Basics/Stamp) section, we learned stamp brush and methods to render it.
We assumed the interval between stamp is a fixed value along a stroke.

> While a user paints on a canvas, we render the texture onto the canvas **equidistantly** along the drawing trace.
> When the textures are close enough, they seem continuous and form a stroke.

But this "fixed interval" pattern is not always the case in practice and may cause a potential rendering problem.
Let's take a look at this problem.

Assume we draw two strokes on a canvas.
The first is a stamp stroke with dot footprint, and the second is a basic solid stroke, as the figure below shows.
I want to copy the first stroke's brush and apply the brush to the second stroke.

![copy](./wrong-copy.png)

You may notice the resulting stroke has denser dots and appearance.
This is because the interval between stamps in the first stroke is equal to the radius of each dot.
In contrast, the interval in the resulting stroke is smaller than its radius.
So, the result stroke's dots are aligned more densely than those in the first stroke.

As we change the stroke radius, the interval between the dots has not been adjusted accordingly.
This leads to the change in appearance.
This is unintuitive since artists expect the concept of "brush" controls the stroke appearance.
Copying and pasting a brush imply the source and target stroke have the same appearance.

Expect for copying brush, the issue also happens when resizing a stroke.
For example, imagine a case that we export vector drawings from a paint program to a game engine.
When rendering the drawings,
the game engine may need to scale the strokes' position and radius to translate them from local space to world space.
Unluckily, a careless programmer like me forgets to scale the stamp interval accordingly.
In the worst case, nothing shows the canvas and I would spend a whole day to debug it.

To avoid the issue, we rarely use a fixed length value as a brush parameter for artist to adjust.
Instead, we make the stamp interval be proportional to the stroke radius,
and use their ratio as the brush parameter.
Here, I call this value **interval ratio**, and denote it with the symbol $\eta$.
$$
\eta = \frac{Interval}{Radius}
$$
For a paint program on the market like Krita, you can definitely find this parameter in its brush editor.
The parameter might be half of the value as defined in our system, because the program uses width value rather than radius value.
We will use radius here for the convenience of mathematical derivation.

The "spacing: 1.0" means the stamp interval is the stroke width, or 2x radius.
So the footprints connect to each other in a row, even though the stroke radius is changed.

To implement this feature with our GPU rendering method, I would set the interval ratio as a uniform in shader.
It is pretty straightforward as the pseudocode below shows.

```glsl
// Get the `interval_ratio` value instead of `interval` from CPU.
uniform float interval_ratio;
float interval = interval_ratio * radius; // The stroke without variable width has only one radius value.
// Everything else remains the same......
```

However, things get tricky when rendering variable-width strokes.
With varying radius values, which one should be used to calculate the interval?
Perhaps the maximum radius of a stroke?
It's a reasonable compromise.
I did it in Ciallo's paper when conducting performance tests (and it seems I forgot about mentioning it).
In a paint program like Krita, the user-specified stroke size, as shown in the figure above, is the perfect choice.
But outside a paint program, it's not easy to get a user-specified radius value.
A better solution is to let the stamp interval vary along with the stroke radius.

### Proportional interval

We will learn how to render the "Proportional interval" stroke shown in the figure below.
Its interval is not fixed but vary along with the stroke radius.
Meanwhile, the interval is always proportional to the radius.

You might be confused by the statement "always proportional to the radius."
Though it's intuitively correct as the animation below shows.
I'll soon explain it with precise mathematical formulas, so don't worry about it too much for now.

Proportional interval has another benefit: Strokes have more consistent appearance!
Watch the start and end points of the fixed interval stroke.
Because the stroke radius drops to zero at these points, these dots are too sparser to keep a continuous feeling.
In contrast, the proportional interval is consistent all along the stroke.
Actually, it's a [fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal) like mandelbrot set.

Krita supports the proportional interval.
We can find the "Auto" toggle button under the "Spacing" setting, as shown in the figure below.
When enabled, the brush draws proportional interval strokes; when disabled, it draws fixed interval strokes.

![spacing auto setting](./krita-spacing-auto.png)

Implementing the proportional interval on the CPU is straightforward.
The interval can be computed dynamically using the current drawn footprint.
Here's the pseudocode for the process:

``` cpp
vec2 currPos = firstStampPosition;
float currRadius = firstStampRadius;
while (currPos != endPos){
  drawFootprint(currPos, currRadius);
  // highlight-next-line
  float interval = currRadius * interval_ratio;
  vec2 nextPos = addAlongThePolyline(currPos, interval);
  vec2 nextRadius = radius(nextPos);
  currPos = nextPos; currRadius = nextRadius;
}
```

The `nextPos` depends on `currPos`, so the process cannot be GPU-accelerated.
To overcome this, we need to eliminate this dependency while maintaining the appearance of the stroke.
It's a significant challenge and will require some calculus to solve it.

## Theory
Given a polyline, pick one of its edges and divide it into infinitely small segments of length $\Delta x$.
We reuse the old local coordinate system, so each segment has its local coordinate $x$,
and we already know the radius at a segment $r(x) = r_0 - \cos\theta x$.

![small segment](./small-segment.png)

We need the stamp interval to be proportional to radius.
Therefore, for each segment, define the stamp interval as $\eta r(x)$.
To find the number of stamps $\Delta N$ in a segment, divide the length by the interval:

$$
\Delta n = \frac{\Delta x}{\eta r(x)}
$$

To find the number of stamps $\Delta n$ over the edge, we need to integrate $\Delta n$ from 0 to x.

$$
n(x) = \int_0^{x} \frac{dx}{\eta r(x)}
$$

Given $r(x) = r_0 - \cos\theta x$, we substitute this into the integral and get:

$$
\tag{1} n(x) = \frac{1}{\eta \cos\theta} \ln(r_0 - \cos\theta x) \bigg|_0^x = \frac{1}{\eta \cos\theta} \ln (1 - \frac{\cos\theta x}{r_0})
$$

Exchange the dependent and independent variable in formula (1) and get:

$$
\tag{2} x(n) = \frac{r_0}{\cos\theta}(1 - e^{\eta\cos\theta n})
$$

As $x = L$, we know the total stamp number on the edge, remind that $\cos\theta L = r_0-r_1$:

$$
\tag{3} n(L) = \frac{1}{\eta \cos\theta}\ln \frac{r_0}{r_1}
$$

Soon we will use the formula (1)(2)(3) in our code.

![store](store-n.png)

How do we place footprint on the polyline?
Imagine a point starts from the first vertex and moves along the polyline.
The stamp number to the first vertex grows with its movement.
Every time the number hits an integer, we place a footprint at this point.

Remind the figure below in the Stamp section.
Given a point or pixel, we calculate a range on the edge that can cover the point.
We label the two roots with $x_1$ and $x_2$.

![locate stamp](./locate-stamp.png)

With the stamp number of each edge $n(L)$, we can prefix sum $n(L)$ the number of stamps from each vertex to the first vertex.
We will store the number into each vertex.
For the current edge, we use $n_0$ and $n_1$ to indicate the stamp number at vertex0 and vertex1.
