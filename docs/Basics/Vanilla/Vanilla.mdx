## Uni-radius

Let's start with a solid stroke with a single radius value.
Later add variable radius to it.

<VanillaStroke />

We are given a set of vertices forming a polyline, randomly select an edge with two consecutive vertices,
labeled as $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ and displayed in the diagram below.
Then render a solid capsule on it shown on the left.
If we render every single edge like this, edges connect to each other naturally, as shown on the right.

| ![edge](./uni-edge.png) | ![edge](./uni-connect.png) |
| :---------------------: | :------------------------: |
|        _An edge_        |     _Connected edges_      |

It sounds deadly simple, right?
The process quite looks like drawing an [articulated arm](https://www.google.com/search?q=articulated+arm+2D+diagram&tbm=isch).
So we just call it _Articulated_ stroke (Line) rendering.

To draw the capsule, we place four new vertices to form a rectangle.
