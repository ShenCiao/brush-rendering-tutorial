## Brush strokes

_Open-source [brush presets by Raghavendra](https://gitlab.com/raghukamath/krita-brush-presets) in Krita._

In graphics design software such as Photoshop and Krita, you can use a wide range of brushes within the paint tool.
Learning how to render these stylized strokes with GPU is valuable.
However, there are over thousands of brushes available in Photoshop, which can be overwhelming to explore.
Luckily, more than 90% of the brushes are designed under the "stamp model", and we call them "stamp brushes".

In the upcoming Stamp section, I will introduce the stamp model and how to implement it in a shader program.
But for your better understanding, I will introduce the basic solid stroke called "vanilla" first.
The vanilla and stamp strokes share the exact same vertex placement method.
It's much easier to start with the vanilla stroke, later the stamp stroke.
Maybe the stamp strokes with various styles don't interest you, feel free to ignore it and learn the vanilla stroke only.
It's very useful when drawing UIs or debugging your 3D scenes.

While you may recognize a brush stroke by its stylization, another crucial property could be ignored: the "variable radius" along the stroke.
(I also ignored it in my paper.)
The radii are typically generated from the pressure values as a stylus presses and moves on a tablet.
The property is critical for experienced artists drawing professional illustrations or animations.
After the artists install a new painting program,
one of the highest priorities is to configure the mapping function from pen pressure to brush radius.

Digital artists paint with dedicated devices: Tablet and Stylus.
If you're unfamiliar with tablets and styluses, you can watch the video below for more information:

## Geometric data

To store the variable radius in brush stroke, we will render a unique type of vector curve:
An ordered list of points (polyline) with radius values assigned to each point.
As a user presses a stylus on a tablet and moves, a paint program generates a sequence of points to record the trace of movement.
Meanwhile, the pen pressure is transformed into the radius value assigned to each point.
After rendering the stroke on the polyline, the user feels like drawing on canvas.

We can approximate any type of curve by increasing the number of points in a polyline, whether freehand-drawn or mathematically defined.
Try to change the `maxRadius` and `segmentCount` values in the code editor below to see how the vanilla stroke changes.
I will elaborate on how to render this stroke in the next section.
Feel free to change any other parts of the code as long as the function returns the `position` and `radius` array correctly.

Blender Grease Pencil team has developed a lot of novel tools to edit this polyline with radius representation.
